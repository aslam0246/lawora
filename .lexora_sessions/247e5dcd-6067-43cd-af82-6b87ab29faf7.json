The consent must be free and voluntary, and not obtained through deception or coercion.\n*   **Promise of Marriage:** In cases involving a false promise of marriage, the prosecution must prove that the man *never* intended to marry the woman at the time the promise was made. A broken promise alone is not enough; there must be evidence of an initial fraudulent intent.\n*   **Comparison to IPC:** This section is similar to Section 375 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) regarding rape but carves out a specific offense for sexual intercourse obtained through deceitful means or false promise of marriage.\n\n**Disclaimer:** I am an AI chatbot and cannot provide legal advice.
